They wake up in a mysterious room in the presence of \"Manabu-kun,\" a character from a controversial children's show that stopped airing due to its malicious content.

They are to play a \"friendship game\": a series of games that will test the strength of their bond and trust in each other. As the group's faith wavers due to the growing number of secrets and betrayals, Yuuichi must figure out who of his \"friends\" he can actually trust and ultimately discover the identity of the traitor. \n\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",
